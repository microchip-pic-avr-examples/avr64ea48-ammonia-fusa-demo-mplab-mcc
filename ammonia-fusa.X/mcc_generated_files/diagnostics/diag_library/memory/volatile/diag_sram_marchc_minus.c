 @misradeviation{@advisory,15.1} To adhere to misra-c2012-15.5, a goto 
 statement is used instead of having an additional return statement when 
 detecting invalid input parameters. This is done because the implementation of 
 this function requires the usage of goto statements regardless. This is because
 the diagnostic function needs to return as soon as an error is detected, without 
 having multiple return statements, and some cleanup is neccesary before exiting 
 when using the @ref SRAM_MARCH_STARTUP mode. Avoiding the use of goto would require 
 either creating a separate cleanup function, which would be called whenever an error 
 is detected (which is not possible since this function cannot call another function), 
 or having multiple additional checks which would add overhead, diminish the code 
 readability and require defaulting the test result to @ref DIAG_PASS. The latter is 
 deemed less safe than only assigning the result to @ref DIAG_PASS when all March 
 elements have run and detected no error. Finally, as misra-c2012-15.2 and misra-c2012-15.3 
 (regarding the usage of goto) is adhered to, the deviation is deemed safe.

 expressions in question are thus not a composite expression as defined by 
 MISRA C:2012.

 @misradeviation{@required,11.4} It is necessary to deviate from this rule when
 manipulating the Stack Pointer (SP) register in this context. This is because 
 the SP register is memory mapped as a `volatile uint16_t`. To compare the stack 
 pointer address and a pointer to an address in SRAM, 
 a conversion from a pointer to an integer type is necessary. In this context, 
 the pointer is converted to an `uint16_t` because addresses in data space are 16 
 bits and it is deemed safer to compare two `uint16_t` values than two 
 pointers. The implementation has been tested thorougly with unit testing and 
 manual inspection of the memory through a debugger to verify that the SP 
 register is loaded with the intended value and that the SP is modified at the 
 appropriate time (based on the aforementioned comparison).
