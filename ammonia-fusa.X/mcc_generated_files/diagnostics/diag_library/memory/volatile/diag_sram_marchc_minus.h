/**
 * @ingroup diag_sram_marchc_minus
 * @brief **Software Requirement Reference ID : SW_SRAM_MARCH_TEST_01**\n
 * Implements the March C- algorithm, converted to a Word-Oriented Memory (WOM) test. 
 * See the @ref wom_conversion section for a full explanation of 
 * how the March algorithm works. See the @ref diag_march_aou section for a list of 
 * all the AoUs for this API. 
 * 
 * @warning The March test is destructive, meaning that all data stored in the 
 * SRAM area under test will be permanently overwritten when the test is completed 
 * to ensure full test coverage of the listed Coupling Faults (CFs) between all
 * bits in SRAM under test.
 * 
 * The test is executed with the following steps:
 * - If in @ref SRAM_MARCH_STARTUP mode, back up the return address from stack 
 * - Verify that the input parameters are valid
 * - Run the inter-word test 
 * - Run the intra-word test 
 * - If in @ref SRAM_MARCH_STARTUP mode, restore the return address to stack 
 * - If in @ref SRAM_MARCH_STARTUP mode, store the result of the test in a 
 *   persistent variable
 * - If in @ref SRAM_MARCH_PARTIAL mode, return the result of the test
 * 
 * If an error is detected while executing any of the March elements, the return 
 * address is restored (in @ref SRAM_MARCH_STARTUP mode), before returning as fast
 * as possible.  
 * 
 * The March C- WOM algorithm consists of the following march elements: 
 * 
 * - Start of the inter-word test:       
 *  - M0 up    (w00000000);           
 *  - M1 up    (r00000000,w11111111); 
 *  - M2 up    (r11111111,w00000000); 
 *  - M3 down  (r00000000,w11111111); 
 *  - M4 down  (r11111111,w00000000); 
 * - Start of the intra-word test:       
 *  - M5 down  (r00000000, w01010101);
 *  - M6 up    (r01010101, w10101010);
 *  - M7 down  (r10101010, w01010101);
 *  - M8 up    (r01010101, w00110011);
 *  - M9 down  (r00110011, w11001100);
 *  - M10 up   (r11001100, w00110011);
 *  - M11 down (r00110011, w00001111);
 *  - M12 up   (r00001111, w11110000);
 *  - M13 down (r11110000, w00001111);
 *  - M14 up   (r00001111);
 * 
 * @note Procedural Abstraction (PA) optimization is disabled for this 
 * function. This assembly optimization can adversely affect the March test 
 * by introducing calls to routines that change the content of the stack in SRAM 
 * and can thus cause the March test to fail. This is achieved by using the 
 * `__nopa` directive, which is expanded to `__attribute__((nopa, noinline))`.
 * This additionally ensures that inlined code is not subject to PA.
 *

 * @param length - Defines the size of the memory under test

 * 
 * @return @ref DIAG_PASS,
 * @return @ref DIAG_FAIL,
 * @return @ref DIAG_INVALID_ARG,
 * @return @ref DIAG_UNDEFINED.
 * 
 * @note In @ref SRAM_MARCH_STARTUP mode, discard the return value as

 * @ref DIAG_SRAM_DATA_REGION_LEN. This API wrapper is intended to be 
 * called periodically to test the next SRAM section as long as
 *  @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_PERIODIC_ENABLED is not zero. Each time the function is called, 
 * the next SRAM section is backed up in a buffer, tested using the @ref DIAG_SRAM_MarchCMinus() 
 * function in  @ref SRAM_MARCH_PARTIAL mode and restored from the buffer before 
 * the result of the test is returned. This is done on all SRAM sections until it
 *  wraps around and starts testing the first SRAM section again. The function also handles 
 * testing the stack area by temporarily moving the stack pointer to a reserved 
 * temporary stack while performing the march test to return safely.
 * Finally, in compliance with AoU-SRAM_MARCH_TEST-07 in @ref diag_march_aou, the
 * Global Interrupt Enable bit is backed up and disabled when entering the function
 * and restored before returning.  
 * 
 * @warning The periodic March test does not give full coverage of the listed fault
 * models. To get full coverage of the listed coupling faults, i.e. detect
 * all possible coupling faults between all bits in the SRAM, the March C minus 
 * algorithm must be executed on the entire SRAM used by the application, which is 
 * done in the @ref DIAG_SRAM_MarchStartup() API. However, as the March algorithm 
 * is destructive, it is not possible to get full fault model coverage periodically
 * unless the application is reset periodically. Thus, this API implements a 
 * nondestructive periodic March test diagnostic with reduced coupling fault 
 * coverage. This approach gives full coupling fault coverage between all bits a
 * section under test, but no coverage of coupling faults between bits in a section
 * under test and the rest of the SRAM used by the application. To somewhat 
 * mitigate this issue, the sections can be configured to overlap each other so 
 * that coupling faults between the overlapping parts of two sections are covered.
 * Since coupling faults are more likely to occur on physically neighbouring bits,
 * it is deemed a sufficient solution to periodically detect SRAM faults. 
 * 
 * @note The size of each SRAM section is determined by the value of 
 * @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_SEC_SIZE and the overlap between sections is given by 
 * @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_SEC_OVERLAP.
 * 
 * @note The Fault Detection Time Interval (`FDTI`) is given by: 
 * `FDTI = N * T, T > t_s` 
 * where `N` is the number of SRAM sections (see @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_SEC_SIZE), 
 * `T` is the period between calls to @ref DIAG_SRAM_MarchPeriodic() and `t_s` is 
 * the execution time of @ref DIAG_SRAM_MarchPeriodic() (which will depend on 
 * @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_SEC_SIZE, optimization level and the main clock frequency).
 * 
 * @note The function reserves two buffers at the start of SRAM for doing backup of
 * an SRAM section and creating a temporary stack when calling the
 * @ref DIAG_SRAM_MarchCMinus() function in @ref SRAM_MARCH_PARTIAL mode when the
 * section under test overlaps the current stack. For this reason, it is required 
 * to add a linker option to move the BSS section to avoid any data collision during
 * compilation. The required linker options are printed as pragma messages during
 * compile time if @ref DIAG_LINKER_OPTION_MSG_ENABLE is not zero. 
 * 
 * @warning The periodic March test assumes that the depth of the application stack 
 * never exceeds a value so that one SRAM section will overlap both the temporary 
 * and current stack pointer. In this scenario, both stacks would be
 * under test and the March test function will not be able to return correctly or 
 * preserve the context of the caller function. Assuming that the stack starts at 
 * @ref DIAG_SRAM_END_ADDR, the maximum stack depth value, stack_max, is given by: \n
 * `tot` = @ref DIAG_SRAM_DATA_REGION_LEN \n
 * `sec` = @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_SEC_SIZE \n
 * `overlap` = @ref DIAG_SRAM_MARCH_SEC_OVERLAP \n
 * `tmp` = @ref DIAG_SRAM_TEMP_STACK_SIZE \n 
 * `stack_max = tot + (sec + tmp)%(sec - overlap) - 2*sec - tmp`, 
 * where `%` is the modulo operator.
 * 
 * @note Procedural Abstraction (PA) optimization is disabled for this 
 * function. This assembly optimization can adversely affect the execution 
 * by introducing calls to routines that change the content 
 * of the stack in the SRAM, and can thus cause the backing up of the stack to fail. 
 * This is achieved by using the `__nopa` directive, 
 * which is expanded to `__attribute__((nopa, noinline))`.
 * This additionally ensures that inlined code is not subject to PA.
