 @ingroup diag_cpu_register
 @brief Validates CPU registers for stuck bits and neighboring Coupling Faults.
        This diagnostic writes a checkerboard pattern and an inverse checkerboard pattern 
        to the testable bits in the CPU registers (R0-R31), Status Register (SREG) and
        the Stack Pointer (SP). If an error is detected, the registers are restored 
        before the test result is returned.

        The diagnostic is built up in the following order:
        1.  The Global interrupts status is backed up and disabled. 
        2.  The CPU register context is pushed to the stack.
        3.  The Zero Flag of the Status Register is tested to ensure that branching is working correctly. 
        4.  The R16 CPU register is tested as it is used for the rest of the test.
        5.  The remaining CPU registers are tested (R0 to R15 and R17 to R31).
        6.  The SREG is tested, except for the Global Interrupt Enable Bit.
        7.  The SP is backed up, tested and restored.
        8.  The CPU register context is restored from the stack.
        9.  Global interrupts status is restored. 
        10. The test result is returned.
 @param None.
 @return @ref DIAG_PASS - Indicates that no Fault was detected by the CPU Registers diagnosis \n
 @return @ref DIAG_FAIL - Indicates that a Fault was detected by the CPU Registers diagnosis \n
