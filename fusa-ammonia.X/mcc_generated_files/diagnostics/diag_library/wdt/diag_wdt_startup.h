/**
 * @ingroup diag_wdt_startup
 * @brief Checks that the WDT is able to issue a timely system reset and 
 * that the WDT counter can be reset at start-up.
 * 
 * This diagnostic is intended to be executed at start-up, before entering the 
 * main function, as it involves multiple device resets. The diagnostic supports 
 * both the scenario where the WDT is enabled (and thus locked) through the FUSE
 * and when it is not. In the former scenario, the diagnostic execution time will 
 * depend on the time-out period chosen for the WDT, while in the latter scenario 
 * the WDT is enabled with the shortest WDT time-out period and disabled upon 
 * exiting the diagnostic.
 * 
 * This diagnostic function assumes global interrupts are disabled. 
 * 
 * Timer Counter A (TCA) is used to verify the timing of the WDT clock source
 * since the TCA clock source is independent. The timer is set up and teared down 
 * as part of running the diagnostic. It is assumed that the timer resource is free 
 * at start-up before entering main.
 * 
 * The diagnostic has the following execution flow: 
 * -# A system reset occurs.
 * -# Back up the Reset Flags register (RSTFR) and clear it.
 * -# Enable the WDT (or reset counter if enabled through FUSE).
 * -# Measure the time it takes for the WDT to issue a system reset.
 * -# Re-enter the diagnostic and check that the system reset occurred.
 * -# Check that the system reset did not occur too soon or too late (with tolerance).
 * -# Check that the WDT counter can be cleared without causing a reset.
 * -# Wait for a WDT system reset to ensure that the counter clear worked correctly.
 * -# Re-enter the diagnostic and store the result of the diagnostic.
 * -# Tear down the timer used for measurement and exit to main function.
 * -# @ref DIAG_WDT_GetResult() must be called from main to get the result of the diagnostic.
 *
 * @warning This diagnostic clears all reset flags in the RSTFR register. Use the 
 * @ref DIAG_WDT_GetRSTFRCopy() API to retrieve the copy of the register at start-up
 * to handle unexpected resets in the application. 
 * 
 * @param None.
